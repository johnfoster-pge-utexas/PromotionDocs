    "text": "I am a somewhat non-traditional teacher in that I rarely give a full 50/75 minute back-to-the-students blackboard-style lecture, preferring interactive project-based learning whenever possible. I have been an early adopter of the reverse classroom approach. I have developed three separate PGE courses (PGE 310/311, PGE 323M, PGE383 - High Performance Computing) using this teaching modality in which all of the traditional lecture materials are posted to YouTube and embedded in a course specific websites that I developed. The students are then required to watch the videos1 before attending class. Accompanying the videos are automatically graded quiz questions to ensure the students complete the videos and continuously provide a feedback assessment of their progress. The in-class part of the course is then offered in a computer lab where daily exercises are carried out in a way that offers students an opportunity to solve problems on their own with my immediate assistance when they need it. Independent projects replace tests in these courses. Thus far I have 100s of lecture videos for these classes. Interestingly, these videos are being watched more often by others, outside of the formal classroom. They currently have over 230K unique views representing more than 800K minutes of viewing on YouTube from interested people in almost every country in the world. Figure 1 shows the historical accumulation of views for the HPC course. I taught this course for 3 semesters at UTSA and am preparing to teach a similar course in the Spring of 2017 to PGE students.\n\n\n\nHistorical daily views of HPC course YouTube channel\n\n\nI believe this serves as a avenue for reputation enhancement, through others familiarizing themselves with my expertise on this topic and seeking out my other contributions in research, etc. Additionally, it creates a lasting catalogue of valuable reference material for my own students and researchers as well as other students at UT.\nThis flipped-classroom format may not be appropriate for all classes; however, I firmly believe in providing the students a menu of options for learning, especially when technology can provide this at little or no time-cost to me. In the classroom, when delivering traditional lectures I use a tablet peripheral interface to my laptop, where I can either develop lecture notes from scratch on blank paper or I can annotate prepared material in real-time. This makes the transition to prepared slides, demos, videos, web-based materials, or live-coding on the laptop during the lecture seamless. While delivering the lecture, I wear a microphone and screen-capture my computer desktop while simultaneously projecting to the screen in the lecture hall. At the end of class, I post the lecture notes developed in class along with a YouTube video of my lecture. Every lecture is recorded and available for the students future reference. I spend a little time post-producing the lecture videos to break-up the full lecture into 5–20 minutes topical segments. This post-production of the lectures makes it easier for the students to find the material they are interested in when reviewing for exams or working assignments. Additionally, this allows me to easily assemble an appropriately timed lecture in the advent of an absence in future semesters. Written comments from students over the years have overwhelmingly expressed gratitude for these reference videos and other materials, as not all students learn in the same manner, it provides a way to accommodate several different learning styles. I have used this methodology in several PGE courses at UT including PGE 379 Advanced Geomechanics2, PGE 334 Reservoir Geomechanics3, and PGE 323M Reservoir Engineering III4. Like the HPC course described previously, these videos are being watched by students around the world and have views cumulatively exceeding 100K. Professors Maša Prodanović and Eric van Oort in the PGE Department have adopted and adapted parts of this methodology after discussions with me regarding the tools I use. Other professors have expressed interest in adopting these techniques, and the possibility of using some of these methods to prepare material for a future online Master of Science degree in PGE has been discussed, including at the PGE 2015 faculty retreat where I gave a live demonstration.\nIt has been my experience that many, if not most, engineering students are aided by visual learning tools and where appropriate I always try to incorporate these into my lectures. Figure [fig:newton] shows an animated computer visualization of tangent lines being drawn and new approximations being computed as a Newton’s method nonlinear solver converges to a root. This is one of many similar such visual aides that I developed (i.e. wrote the Mathematica code) for a course on numerical methods5, these notebooks are currently being translated to an open-source interactive book6.\nI prefer a grading procedure which emphasizes homework assignments and projects that include applications to real engineering problems that the personal computer is needed to solve. As a working engineer, it was a rare case to encounter a problem that could be easily solved analytically; therefore, the computer plays a vital role in the education of my students just as it would assist a working engineer. I would say the primary educational goal for every course I teach is for the students to become better programmer/problem solvers through the use of scientific computing. I force the students to write computer code for nearly every assignment by designing problems that require iteration or full-field and/or multiple parameter space visualizations that are too difficult or intractable to work by hand. I do not insist they use any particular language or engineering software toolbox, but rather emphasize choosing the right tool for the task by discussing the pro/cons regarding speed, algorithm robustness, and ease of programming with them. Begin proficient in several programming languages and engineering sofware packages (virtually all of the most commonly used ones) allows me to do this with ease. I emphasize good coding practices that make their codes easier to debug. I force them to solve verification problems, and to test their code so that they have confidence that the solutions they turn in are correct. I frequently live-code on my laptop in class to explain not only syntax, but the logic of programming which often is the logic of problem solving. I even discuss software developer operations such as agile, testing, and version control when appropriate. I have held ad hoc tutorials outside of class on such topics7. The students I have taught so far seem to respond well to these course designs, despite the common misconception that “engineers don’t like to code”. It’s possible that engineers do not recognize the full worth of programming when taught as a stand-alone subject, but when taught programming as part of the art of problem solving, nearly every student I have encountered develops an appreciation and they have expressed this in written comments during course evaluations.\nI firmly believe that, just as no exceptions are ever made for engineering students who must use a slide-rule when preparing exam questions (i.e. it’s an expectation that all students have access to a scientific calculator), we have reached the time when the same philosophy should be applied with respect to the laptop computer. When teaching PGE 334 Advanced Geomechanics in the Spring of 2016, for the first time, I allowed students to use their personal or department provided laptops during exams. In this course, there are a class of problems which require using rotation matrices to perform multiple coordinate transformations for the solution. If the students are asked to solve these problems on an exam, an assessment of their performance is influence by how quickly they can type matrices into their calculators. This is not in anyway an assessment of their understanding. I allowed them to program the coordinate transformations and bring their codes with them to class. I even provided verification solutions so they could check that their code was working properly before the exam. They could simply use the code during the problem solution with little worry about making algebraic or typographic errors and allowing them to focus on their physical understanding of the problem. The overall grades on otherwise very similar exams improved dramatically from the previous semester when I taught this course.\nBeing formally trained as a mechanician, I have a very different background than a traditional petroleum engineer; however, it is my belief that this skill set adds tremendous value in a future where unconventional resources will play a large role in the petroleum industry. These unconventionals require extensive knowledge of geomechanics to efficiently and safely bring into production. Indeed PGE’s curriculum has already began to reflect this by adding both undergraduate and graduate courses in geomechanics over the last several years (i.e. PGE334 and PGE373, both of which I have taught). Additionally, my background in scientific computing and the numerical solution of PDE’s allowed me to seamlessly begin to teach courses in reservoir simulation (PGE323M).\nI have always been rated highly in student evaluations. The worst instructor evaluation I have received was in PGE 334 Advanced Geomechanics during the Spring of 2015 (my first time teaching this course and the largest course I had ever taught at the time by a significant amount). The evaluation was a 3.4 which I improved to a 4.3 the next time I taught the course. I attribute the improvement to better preparation (second time teaching the course), a more knowledgable and efficient use of teaching assistants in a large class, as well as implementing new techniques, such as using laptops for exams as previously discussed. This improvement was in spite of requiring the students to program for every assignment, something they supposedly don’t like to do! Generally my instructor ratings are in the 4’s. Table 1 provides a summary of my course and instructor ratings since becoming an assistant professor in the Fall of 2011.\nWith regard to assisting (primarily graduate) students in their learning process, I maintain an active weblog8 of helpful tips and answered questions. Generally these are related to scientific computing topics. I try to maintain a philosophy where anytime I believe a student’s question will come up again in the future, I write a blog detailing the path forward as opposed to providing an individual answer. This has paid off numerous times where I can simply point the students to a blog post where I’ve already answered their specific or a similar question.\nI believe I have demonstrated real innovation in the classroom, notably through the use of technology, and I was awarded the 2015 Society of Petroleum Engineers Faculty Innovative Teaching Award in this regard. Another accomplishment I am very proud of, but is admittedly not completely my own, was for my Teaching Assistant for PGE 323M in Fall 2015, Nkemakonam Egboga, to be awarded the William S. Livingston Outstanding Graduate Student Academic Employee Award by the Graduate Student Assembly. This award, for which I prepared the nomination package, is given to one graduate teaching assistant in the entire university. Nkemakonam was the first PGE student and the first Cockrell School of Engineering student to ever be given this award.\nFinally, I believe experience with these innovative approaches to teaching will give me an advantage if called on to participate in the PGE Departments forthcoming online MS program or The University of Texas System’s delivery of online or massively online courses, e.g. the edX program, something I would be interested in doing in the future.\n\n\nSummary of Course-Instructor Ratings\n\n\nMetric\nValue\n\n\n\n\nUT\nTotal9\n\n\nTotal of students taught in organized courses\n198\n363\n\n\nAverage instructor evaluation for UG courses\n3.9\n4.1\n\n\nAverage instructor evaluation for Grad courses\n4.5\n4.5\n\n\nAverage course evaluation for UG courses\n3.8\n4.0\n\n\nAverage course evaluation for Grad courses\n4.3\n4.4\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse Schedule by Semester with Number of Students Indicated\n\n\n\nUTSA10\\(^{,}\\)11\n\n\n\n\nUT-Austin12\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCourse\nF11\nS12\nF12\nF13\nS14\nF14\nS15\nF15\nS16\n\n\nME4603\n21\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME6043\n\n3\n\n\n6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nME4953/5013\n\n\n39\n48\n48\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPGE379\n\n\n\n\n\n13\n\n14\n\n\n\nPGE334\n\n\n\n\n\n\n81\n\n25\n\n\nPGE323M\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n65"

    "text": "Overview. I am primarily known for my theoretical and computational contributions to the relatively new field of peridynamics research. I am one of the highest cited researchers in the field and am the fourth largest code contributor to the most popular open source peridyamics code, Peridigm (&gt;62k lines of code contributed, additionally UT graduate students have contribued &gt;10k lines of code under my supervision). Peridynamics is one of the leading computational methods for modeling dynamic and pervasive material failure. It has been used at Boeing for composite material aircraft design, at Corning for the evaluation of glass in iPhones, and has been implemented in the popular commercial FEA software LS-DYNA as well as several other open-source codes. Peridigm has been used and cited in hundreds of studies/articles by researchers all over the world. I have worked on problems involving both brittle and ductile failure, participated in several Sandia Fracture Challenges, published several papers on new constitutive and failure theories, multiphysics and multiscale modeling, hydraulic fracturing, and recently published extensive numerical validation experiments on using peridynamics for complex concrete modeling effectively putting to rest some long standing (and high profile) criticisms of peridynamics.\nMy research has been supported through competitive grants from ARO, AFOSR through prestigious Young Investigator and MURI grants, Sandia National Laboratories and numerous energy companies. Recently, I shifted my research to focus on scientific machine learning applications in petroleum engineering, co-founding the DiReCT IAP research consortium with Prof. Michael Pyrcz in 2019. Our IAP is one of the most successful new IAPs in the Hildebrand Department with 9 companies (Chevron, ExxonMobile, Coterra, Equinor, Shell, Total, Japex, BP, Aramco) as current members each contributing $60k/year. Prof. Pyrcz leads the administrative aspects of the IAP, e.g. billing and organizing our annual meeting; whereas, I lead our organized efforts for open-source software distribution by administering our Github organization and instructing IAP graduate students on proper software engineering operations. We both supervise graduate student research projects individually and as co-supervisors (currently co-supervising 3 students together). Broadly, the IAP is focusing on data science and machine learning novel methods development to applications in petroleum engineering. Prof. Pyrcz’s research focus is primarly on geostatistics and petroleum reservoir modeling; whereas, I am working on incorporating physical constraints (e.g. engineering conservation laws) into machine learning methods. Our backgrounds and expertise compliment each other well, and we believe the IAP will provide sustained funding for many years into the future given the promise and interest of using data science and machine learning, i.e. “Artificial Intelligence”, for petroleum engineering decision making.\nPublications. I have published more than 54 peer reviewed journal articles1 (&gt;32 in rank) and book chapters. I co-edited and contributed to the book, Handbook of Peridynamic Modeling (&gt;390 citations). I have consistently published in the top journals in mechanics and computational mechanics including CMAME (IF 6.6), JMPS (IF: 5.5), JCP (IF: 4.4), Computational Mechanics (IF: 4.4), IJSS (IF: 3.7) and others. One significant paper was on the front page of the respective journal as a “most downloaded article” continuously for over 10 years2,3! Another paper, on nonlocal frictional contact, is currently on the most downloaded page in the Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling. My overall citations are strong (&gt;2900 citations) and growing, receiving more than 500 citations in each of the last two years (on pace for &gt;600 citations in 2023). My \\(h\\)-index is currently 27, I have 8 published works with more than 100 citations and 3 with more that 200 citations. Finally, it’s worth noting that my citations have continued to grow in an upward trajectory given the field of peridynamics has been growing rapidly. A screen capture of my Google Scholar citations chart is shown in Figure 1.\nSignificant Research in Rank. What I consider to be one of my most significant works in rank was recently published in the Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids (paper 26 on CV). This paper implements an advanced microplane constitutive model (M7) developed by Prof. Zdeněk Bažant (NAS, NAE, AAAS, Royal Society of London, 7 honorary doctorates, etc.) and students over many years for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials. Prof. Bažant has long been a critic of peridynamics. After many unsuccessful conversations trying to convince him that peridynamics could be viewed as a regularized discritization technique that allows for straightforward modeling of material failure without mass loss, I initiated a research collaboration with Prof. Yuri Bazilevs and Dr. Masoud Behzadinasab at Brown University to demonstrate this claim clearly. Masoud was a recent UT-Engineering Mechanics PhD who graduated under my supervision. His PhD work had all the foundational elements for implementing the M7 model easily in our open source Peridigm code. Masoud and I implemented the M7 model that is distributed by Prof. Bažant as an Abaqus UMAT material model written in Fortran 90. Without changing a single line of the constitutive model code, we built a UMAT interface to Peridigm and ran 11 different numerical validation experiments. These tests all involved different stress loading paths and various fracture/notch tests to elucidate the effects of pressure dependence, stress triaxiality, size effects, and other factors on concrete failure. The results we published demonstrate good agreement with all 11 tests and the published computational results from Prof. Bažant’s group using a regularized finite element implementation. Unlike the finite element results, our peridynamics simulations also show fracture localization and fracture patterns that are more in agreement with experiments. I see this work as the culmination of many years of constitutive model development from my group to provide a stable and accurate discretization technique that can use any classical stress-strain constitutive model for fracture modeling. The papers directly related to kinematic measures and constitutive model development that lead to this work are papers 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17 on my CV. Additionally, papers 4, 16, 18 were related to high-order discretization techniques that were demonstrated to produce the numerically stable formulation used in this work. When this work was published, Dr. Stewart Silling from Sandia National Laboratories, the originator of peridynamic theory and Distingushed Member of the Technical Staff (highest technical rank at Sandia) with over 18k citations, wrote us and personally thanked us for writing the paper, with the sentiment that the paper rebutted Prof. Bažant’s criticisms. A screenshot of this email is shown in Figure 2.\nOne of the papers mentioned above, paper 18, I also consider to be of high-significance. It was published in the SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis. In that paper we present a discretization technique for nonlocal models based on reproducing kernel approximation theory that is proven to be “asymptotically compatible,” this means that the discrete solution converges to the nonlocal solution as the characteristic nonlocality is held fixed and the mesh is refined and converges to the local solution as the characteristic nonlocality vanishes along with mesh refinement. Additionally, it’s a nodally integrated collocation scheme; therefore it’s more computationally efficient than using Gauss integration techniques. We prove stability and convergence of the scheme by comparing to the Galerkin discretization of the nonlocal model which has previously proven to be stable. This paper demonstrates the mathematical rigor our group has applied to nonlocal computational mechanics novel method development.\nFinally, with my shift in research focus towards scientific machine learning in 2019, I have published several papers on the topic including papers 20, 21, 27, 29–31. I believe the most significant of these is paper 25, published in Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering in 2022. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture for uncertainty quantification. The idea is quite elegant in its simplicity and performs remarkably well. We construct a feed-forward neural network and add physical balance laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function that is minimized during training to “learn” the solution. The key novelty is that instead of a single output corresponding to the solution of the PDE, we allow for many outputs. Each output corresponds to the solution of the balance law for training data that has been sampled from a distribution. The data could correspond to uncertain measurements of the field quantities of the balance law, uncertain measurements of boundary/initial conditions, or uncertainty in material parameters depending upon whether a forward or inverse solution is desired (both are demonstrated in the paper). We show that we can train a single network to produce an ensemble of solutions that form a distribution. We demonstrate that this distribution agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations conducted by solving the PDEs via the finite element method. We present a method for quantitatively comparing the two distributions with accuracy measures. While PINN methods, when training time is amortized over some number of forward solution runs, often result in longer solution times with lower accuracy than traditional PDE solvers for forward problems (e.g. FEM), the MO-PINN technique can produce the uncertain distributions faster than traditional FEM-based Monte Carlo techniques. This is especially true for inverse problems. This technique has the potential for transformative impact in the field of uncertainty quantification for computational science and engineering.\nResearch related honors. I received the 2023 Society of Petroleum Engineers Regional Data Science and Engineering Award. In 2018, I was awarded a Moncrief Grand Challenge Award from the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. I received a 2013 AFOSR Young Investigator Award, was named to the 2013 ‘40 Under 40’ from the San Antonio Business Journal. I have given numerous invited talks at both national and international symposium and elite universities (Caltech, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Illinois, Vanderbilt, etc.). I recently delivered a conference plenary lecture at Africomp 5. Among the other plenary speakers were Wing Kam Lui, a chaired professor at Northwestern University with &gt;60k citations, and Peter Wriggers, &gt;30k citations and widely viewed as one of the top technical and organizational leaders in computational mechanics in Europe, à la Tinsely Oden or Tom Hughes in the US.\nGrants. The tables below show research grants that have been awarded, pending, or proposed in the rank of associate professor. The total funds for the awarded and pending projects is $3.56 MM and my share of those awards is $1.23 MM.\nIt’s worth noting that I had two large grants, ARO ($345k) and AFOSR MURI (~$960k), that were awarded late in my assistant professor rank (therefore not shown in these tables, refer to CV) that carried over 2 and 3 years respectively after my tenure package was submitted. If we amortize the research spending of all awarded grants over time, we can see that I actually spent far more in rank than is indicated in the tables. This, along with the fact that my research is purely theoretical and computational (effectively only needing GRA support funds – no equipment) is how I was able to support the 8 PhD students who graduated under my supervision in rank  and is a primary reason that I wrote fewer proposals during the first few years of my associate professor rank. Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative research spending for my share of research grants since coming to academia.\nAdditionally, I shifted my research direction significantly in 2019 towards scientific machine learning applications in petroleum engineering co-founding the DiReCT IAP with Prof. Michael Pyrcz. Our efforts in launching this IAP were severely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic (we launched with 5 companies committed to join and then had 3 summarily drop out in the Spring/Summer of 2020 due to budget concerns and widespread layoffs that affected the oil and gas industry during COVID). However, the future looks bright as we now have 9 companies, including 3 that signed agreements to join just in the first half of 2023. I have included a projection for future research spending (my share), assuming the 9 companies we currently have continue in the IAP as well as the pending proposals that have been notified of award (Table 3) in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Cumulative Spending\nTable 1: External Grants and Contracts Awarded in Rank - Current\n\n\nRole of Candidate\nNames and Roles of Co-Investigators\nGrant Title\nSource of Funds/ Funding Agency\nProject Total\nCandidates Share\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\nPI\n\nAssessing Capillary End Effects on Large Scale Tight Reservoir Drainage\nAmerican Chemical Society\n$110,000\n$110,000\n1/2021-12/2023\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n\n$110,000\n$110,000\nTable 2: External Grants and Contracts Awarded in Rank - Completed\n\n\nRole of Candidate\nNames and Roles of Co-Investigators\nGrant Title\nSource of Funds/ Funding Agency\nProject Total\nCandidates Share\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\nPI\n\nASCeND: ASymptotically Compatible strong form foundations for Nonlocal Discretization.\nSandia National Laboratories\n$300,000\n$300,000\n9/2018-10/2021\n\n\nPI\n\nStudent and Postdoc Travel Support for the 15th USNCCM in Austin, TX\nNSF, Proj.
