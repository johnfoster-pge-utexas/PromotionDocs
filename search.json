    "text": "John T. Foster\nAssociate Professor, Hildebrand Department of Petroleum & Geosystems Eng.\nDepartment of Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics\nOden Instititute for Computational and Engineering Science\nOverview: I am one of the highest cited researchers in the relatively new field of peridynamics and am the fourth largest code contributor to the most popular open source peridyamics code, Peridigm (62k+ lines of code contributed). Peridynamics is one of the leading computational methods for modeling dynamic and pervasive material failure. It has been used at Boeing for composite material aircraft design, at Corning for the evaluation of glass in iPhones, and has been implemented in the popular commercial FEA software LS-DYNA as well as several other open-source codes. I have worked on problems involving both brittle and ductile failure, participated in several Sandia Fracture Challenges, published several papers on new constitutive and failure theories, multiphysics and multiscale modeling, hydraulic fracturing, and recently published extensive numerical validation experiments on using peridynamics for complex concrete modeling effectively putting to rest some long standing (and high profile) criticisms of peridynamics.\nMy research has been supported through competitive grants from ARO, AFOSR through prestigious Young Investigator and MURI grants, Sandia National Laboratories and numerous energy companies. In 2019, I shifted my research to focus on scientific machine learning applications in petroleum engineering, co-founding the DiReCT IAP research consortium with Michael Pyrcz. Our IAP is the most successful new IAP in the Hildebrand Department with 7 companies currently involved.\nPublications: I have published more than 50 peer reviewed journal articles1 and book chapters. I co-edited the book, “Handbook of Peridynamic Modeling”. I have consistently published in the top journals in mechanics and computational mechanics including CMAME (IF 6.6), JMPS (IF: 5.5), JCP (IF: 4.4), Computational Mechanics (IF: 4.4), IJSS (IF: 3.7) and others. One significant paper was on the front page of the respective journal as a “most downloaded article” continuously for over 10 years (WBM capture 1, WBM capture 2)! Another paper, on nonlocal frictional contact, is currently on the most downloaded page in the Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling. My overall citations are strong and growing, receiving more than 500 citations in each of the last two years. Finally, it’s worth noting that my citations have continued to grow year over year as the field of peridynamics has been growing rapidly.\nSignificant Research in Rank: What I consider to be one of my most significant works in rank was recently published in the Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids (paper 48 on CV). This paper implements an advanced microplane constitutive model (M7) developed by Prof. Zdeněk Bažant and students over many years for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials. Prof. Bažant has long been a vocal critic of peridynamics. After many unsuccessful conversations trying to convince him that peridynamics could be viewed as a regularized discritization technique that allows for straightforward modeling of material failure without mass loss, I initiated a research collaboration with Prof. Yuri Bazilevs and Dr. Masoud Behzadinasab at Brown University to demonstrate this claim clearly. Masoud was a recent UT-Engineering Mechanics PhD who graduated under my supervision. His PhD work had all the foundational elements for implementing the M7 model easily in our open source Peridigm code. Masoud and I implemented the M7 model that is distributed by Prof. Bažant as an Abaqus UMAT material model written in Fortran 90. Without changing a single line of the constitutive model code, we built a UMAT interface to Peridigm and ran 11 different numerical validation experiments. These tests all involved different stress loading paths and various fracture/notch tests to elucidate the effects of pressure dependence, stress triaxiality, and other factors on concrete failure. The results we published demonstrate good agreement with all 11 tests and the published computational results from Prof. Bažant’s group using a regularized finite element implementation. Unlike the finite element results, our peridynamics simulations also show fracture localization and fracture patterns that are more in agreement with experiments. I see this work as the culmination of many years of constitutive model development from my group to provide a stable and accurate discretization technique that can use any classical stress-strain constitutive model for fracture modeling. The papers directly related to kinematic measures and constitutive model development that lead to this work are papers 25, 30, 32, 34, 36, 39 on my CV. Additionally, papers 26, 38, 40 were related to high-order discretization techniques that were demonstrated to produce the numerically stable formulation used in this work. When this work was published, Dr. Stewart Silling from Sandia National Laboratories, the originator of peridyanmic theory, wrote us and personally thanked us for writing the paper, feeling that the paper thoroughly rebutted Prof. Bažant’s criticisms once and for all.\nOne of the papers mentioned above, paper 40, I also consider to be of high-significance. It was published in the SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis. In that paper we present a discretization technique for nonlocal models based on reproducing kernel approximation theory that is proven to be “asymptotically compatible,” this means that the discrete solution converges to the nonlocal solution as the characteristic nonlocality is held fixed and the mesh is refined AND converges to the local solution as the characteristic nonlocality vanishes along with mesh refinement. Additionally, it’s a nodally integrated collocation scheme; therefore much more computationally efficient than using Gauss integration techniques. We prove stability and convergence of the scheme by comparing to the Galerkin discretization of the nonlocal model which has previously proven to be stable. This paper demonstrates the mathematical rigor our group has applied to nonlocal computational mechanics novel method development.\nFinally, with my shift in research focus towards scientific machine learning in 2019, I have published several papers on the topic including papers 42, 43, 47, 49–53. I believe the most significant of these is paper 47, published in Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering in 2022. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture for uncertainty quantification. The idea is quiet elegant in it’s simplicity and performs remarkable well. We construct a feed-forward neural network and add physical balance laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function that is minimized during training to “learn” the solution. The key novelty is that instead of a single output corresponding to the solution of the PDE, we allow for many outputs. Each output corresponds to the solution of the balance law for training data that has been sampled from a distribution. The data could correspond to uncertain measurements of the field quantities of the balance law, uncertain measurements of boundary/initial conditions, or uncertainty in material parameters depending upon whether a forward or inverse solution is desired (both are demonstrated in the paper). We show that we can train a single network to produce an ensemble of solutions that form a distribution. We demonstrate that this distribution agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations conducted by solving the PDEs via the finite element method. We present a method for quantitatively comparing the two distributions with accuracy measures. While PINN methods, when training time is amortized over some number of forward solution runs, often result in longer solution times with lower accuracy than traditional PDE solvers for forward problems (e.g. FEM), the MO-PINN technique can produce the uncertain distributions faster than traditional FEM-based Monte Carlo techniques. This is especially true for inverse problems. This technique has the potential for transformative impact in the field of uncertainty quantification for computational science and engineering.\nResearch related honors: I received the 2023 Society of Petroleum Engineers Regional Data Science and Engineering Award. In 2018, I was awarded a Moncrief Grand Challenge Award from the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. I received a 2013 AFOSR Young Investigator Award, was named to the 2013 ‘40 Under 40’ from the San Antonio Business Journal. I have given numerous invited talks an both national and international symposium and elite universities (Caltech, Northwestern, Illinois, Vanderbilt, etc.). I recently delivered a conference plenary lecture at Africomp 5. Among the other plenary speakers were Wing Kam Lui and Peter Wriggers."
