    "text": "Service to the Hildebrand Department. In rank at UT-PGE, I have served on the following department committees:\n\nPGE Undergraduate Studies 2015–2017, Chair 2019–present\nPGE Graduate Studies, 2017–2018\nPGE Graduate Admissions, 2015-2017\nPGE Department Award Committee 2014–2017\nPGE Graduate Seminar Organizer, Fall 2017\n\nDuring the transition to remote learning during the Spring 2020 semester brought on by the COVID19 pandemic, I was asked by our department chair to form an ad hoc committee on to provide “best practices for online/distance learning”. We quickly developed a Wiki based on my experiences using various technologies for teaching, and I even personally recorded some “How To” videos to assist other faculty with this transition.\nAdditionally, I have participated in the preparing and grading the math qualifying exam and have suggested and helped coordinate the visits of many seminar speakers. In general, I would say I am “engaged” in supplemental department activities at a level that only a few other PGE faculty are. I try in earnest to attend events like the distinguished alumni dinner and alumni tailgate, freshmen retreat, SPE student chapter activities, lunches with invited speakers, graduate recruiting events (in PGE, ASE/EM, and for the Oden Institute CSEM program), etc.\nService to the School and University. As an associate professor, I haven’t been called on very often to participate in committees above the department level, although I have served on the following committees:\n\nCockrell School Degrees & Courses 2021-2022\nCockrell School Engineering Honors 2015-2019\n\nService to the Nation, State and Community. I have reviewed 1-2 papers a month for my entire time in rank. I have reviewed papers for the following journals: Computational Geosciences, Journal of Applied Mechanics, Computational Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, Journal of Computational Particle Mechanics, Journal of Microelectromechanical Systems, Computational Mechanics, Int. Journal of Fracture, Applied Mathematics & Computation, Int. Journal of Impact Engineering, Engineering Fracture Mechanics, Experimental Mechanics, Review of Scientific Instruments, Int. Journal of Multiscale Computational Engineering, Int. Journal of Solids and Structures, CMC: Computers, Materials, & Continua, Journal of Mechanics of Materials and Structures.\nI serve as an associate editor for the Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling.\nI have served on NSF panels for the Mechanics of Materials program. I have reviewed proposals for the American Chemical Society’s Petroleum Research Fund and DOEs BES and ASCR programs.\nI have been very active in service within the computational mechanics community, organizing numerous mini-symposia annually at conferences from ASME, EMI, WCCM, and USACM.\nMore notably, I have organized several Thematic Workshops for USACM, including the following:\n\nWorkshop on Nonlocal Methods in Fracture\n\nHeld at UT-Austin, Janruary 15–16, 2018\n\nWorkshop on Isogeometric Analysis and Meshfree Methods\n\nHeld at UCSD, October 10–12, 2016\n\n\nMost importantly, I was the conference chair of the US National Congress on Computational Mechanics 15 (USNCCM 15) held in Austin, TX, July 28–August 1, 2019. This conference was attended by &gt;1000 people, with a budget &gt;$1M, that returned &gt;$200k profit to the professional organization (USACM). I worked for 4 years on this conference, wrote the proposal to USACM to host the conference in Austin, raised ~$60k in grants to support student travel for the conference (including $25k by way of an NSF proposal). Two of our four plenary speakers were UT faculty and women (Karen Wilcoxx and Mary Wheeler)! A third was a UT grad and the 4th is a Austin business owner. All were invited/selected by myself. My role in organizing contributed to considerable positive exposure for UT, UT PGE and the City of Austin."

    "text": "Introduction. I find interacting with students outside of the classroom, both in a formal advisory setting, as well as in informal roles to be the most rewarding part of being a professor. The ability to observe and assist students to develop into independent researchers, thinkers, and problem solvers was a major motivating factor in my decision to leave Sandia National Laboratories and join academia in 2011. I view the students as the primary “product” of my research and teaching efforts, and I always treat them with the utmost respect. I make every effort to learn their names in class and take time to speak to them in the hallways of CPE. When I’m on the 3rd floor of CPE I attempt to make daily “walk-thrus” in the Caudle Center (PGEs student study lounge) to speak to the students. I have an “open door” approach to office hours, and inform the students in class that I hope they will all stop by and ask questions of both a technical and personal nature. I have supported and mentored both undergraduate and graduate students working in my lab as research assistants and in temporary assignments over summer sessions. Table 1 and Table 2 summarize my formal advising efforts. I will discuss the details of these endeavours in the following sections.\nI’d also like to add that I seek out opportunities to promote and assist students. I have many graduate students who have had summer internships that were brought-about through my research connections. I have helped my own graduate students and others on several occasions find work as summer interns at Sandia National Laboratories through my connections. I never hesitate to take the time to write strong letters of recommendations for students seeking employment or applying to graduate programs.\nAdvising graduate students. Table 1 shows the details of the eight PhD graduate students (6 sole supervised) that have completed their degrees under my supervision. I have supervised students through thier PhD degrees in each of the departments I am affiliated, namely PGE, EM, and CSEM. Additionally, I have supervised 7 MS students. For those not co-supervised, I provided GRAs for all them throughout the first 3-4 years of thier respective programs, and elsewhere worked to provide TAs. Aside from Odai Elyas, who was sponsered by Saudi Aramco for his MS degree, none of my students have been “self-supported”.\nThe PhD student I am most proud to have advised is Mingyuan Yang. Mingyuan struggled through his first few years as a PhD student, partly brought on by confidence and mental health issues. Despite his apparent lack of progress, I never lost confidence in his technical ability and continued to encourage him. Late in 2019, we eventually discussed him leaving the program and developed a plan where I would allow him to TA for me in the Spring of 2020 while he searched for a permanent job. Additionally, in Janurary 2020, I was providing a professional education shortcourse on data science and machine learning in Houston, TX and told him that if he could make his way to Houston, he could sit in on the class free-of-charge, possibly providing him an upskilling opportunity to improve his resume. Then COVID hit… The oil and gas industry was not hiring and he was faced with returning to China during the pandemic. He used his newfound machine learning skills and reengaged with his research and went through a remarkable period of productivity and original thought. He ended up publishing 3 papers in the last 2 years of his PhD, including one in Computational Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering (CMAME), the top journal in computational mechanics. I am proud of Mingyuan for not giving up and proud of myself for recognizing his talent and sticking with him despite his struggles.\nLikely, my “best” PhD student in rank was Masoud Behzadinasab. Masoud graduated with a PhD in Engineering Mechanics in 4 years during which time he published 7 papers in the some of the best journals in mechanics (JMPS, IJSS). He won the “Best Student Paper Award” from the ASME Applied Mechanics Division at the 2018 ASME IMECE conference. Masoud went on to a postdoc at Brown University and then was offerned a faculty position at Iowa State University which he declined to pursue a job in industry. Later, in the Fall of 2022, he was invited for an on campus interview to UTs Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics (the department he graduated from). While ultimately he was not selected for the position, just being invited was a huge accolade given the department and colleges culture of not typically hiring recent graduates.\nMy goal for all PhD students is to publish at least 3 papers in good journals. I firmly believe that the role of a PhD advisor is to seed ideas and provide mentorship, but allow the students the creative freedom to develop their own research paths. The PhD degree to me is a sort-of certification or endorsement by the advisor, department, school, and university that the student has the skill-set required to do independent research. I require my PhD students to demonstrate this skill-set, and am committed to preserving the quality of the PhD programs I am involved with. Nevertheless, I encourage my students to move to the next phase of their careers when they have demonstrated their preparedness, and have no interest in holding back productive people to “squeeze a little more out of them.” The ideal PhD student in my mind is one in which the advisors primary role is to simply tell them when they are finished.\nMy goal for MS students is to publish at least one paper in a good journal. Xiao Xu’s MS thesis research resulted in a paper in one of the best journal in mechanics (journal paper 3 on CV). While I’ve fallen short of that one paper goal in some cases, I believe all of the students research that I have supervised is “publishable”, and in most cases we have manuscripts still in preparation held up by the student’s departure. All of the MS students that I have supervised have done “thesis options”, and have finished in appropriate time-scales for the required effort of a thesis (i.e. 1.5–2.5 years). They have all been encouraged and allowed to present their work at national and international conferences which I provided financial support to attend.\nI currently supervise and provide funding for a group of seven students (see Table 2). All of the students co-supervised with Micheal Pyrcz are funded through our DiReCT IAP which should provide stable support for all of these students through their expected graduation dates. Mohammad Suaid is sponsored by Saudi Aramco, Nelson Morrow is working on his MS part-time as he has commitments to the US Army Reserve and using his GI Bill for support. The other students have been supported on various other projects and with TAs. I plan to recruit at least one new PhD student in the Spring 2023 to work on the DOE project that we were just awarded (see Pending Grants table in Research Statement).\nOther significant mentoring approaches. With regard to assisting (primarily graduate) students in their learning process, I maintain an active blog of helpful tips and answered questions. Generally these are related to scientific computing topics. I try to maintain a philosophy where anytime I believe a student’s question will come up again in the future, I write a blog detailing the path forward as opposed to providing an individual answer. This has paid off numerous times where I can simply point the students to a blog post where I’ve already answered their specific or a similar question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Degrees Conferred to Graduate Students Supervised\n\n\nStudent Name\nCo-Supervisor\nDegree\nStart Date\nGraduation Date\nPlacement\n\n\n\n\nMingyuan Yang\n\nPhD PGE\n1/2016\n8/2022\nPostdoc at Peking University\n\n\nRambod Yousefzadeh Tabasi\n\nPhD EM\n1/2017\n5/2022\nApple\n\n\nXiao Xu\n\n8/2016\n5/2022\nPhD CSEM\nBanma Network Technology\n\n\nMayowa Olugbenga Oyedere\nK.

    "text": "Overview. I am primarily known for my theoretical and computational contributions to the relatively new field of peridynamics research. I am one of the highest cited researchers in the field and am the fourth largest code contributor to the most popular open source peridyamics code, Peridigm (&gt;62k lines of code contributed, additionally UT graduate students have contribued &gt;10k lines of code under my supervision). Peridynamics is one of the leading computational methods for modeling dynamic and pervasive material failure. It has been used at Boeing for composite material aircraft design, at Corning for the evaluation of glass in iPhones, and has been implemented in the popular commercial FEA software LS-DYNA as well as several other open-source codes. Peridigm has been used and cited in hundreds of studies/articles by researchers all over the world. I have worked on problems involving both brittle and ductile failure, participated in several Sandia Fracture Challenges, published several papers on new constitutive and failure theories, multiphysics and multiscale modeling, hydraulic fracturing, and recently published extensive numerical validation experiments on using peridynamics for complex concrete modeling effectively putting to rest some long standing (and high profile) criticisms of peridynamics.\nMy research has been supported through competitive grants from ARO, AFOSR through prestigious Young Investigator and MURI grants, Sandia National Laboratories and numerous energy companies. Recently, I shifted my research to focus on scientific machine learning applications in petroleum engineering, co-founding the DiReCT IAP research consortium with Prof. Michael Pyrcz in 2019. Our IAP is one of the most successful new IAPs in the Hildebrand Department with 9 companies (Chevron, ExxonMobile, Coterra, Equinor, Shell, Total, Japex, BP, Aramco) as current members each contributing $60k/year. Prof. Pyrcz leads the administrative aspects of the IAP, e.g. billing and organizing our annual meeting; whereas, I lead our organized efforts for open-source software distribution by administering our Github organization and instructing IAP graduate students on proper software engineering operations. We both supervise graduate student research projects individually and as co-supervisors (currently co-supervising 3 students together). Broadly, the IAP is focusing on data science and machine learning novel methods development to applications in petroleum engineering. Prof. Pyrcz’s research focus is primarly on geostatistics and petroleum reservoir modeling; whereas, I am working on incorporating physical constraints (e.g. engineering conservation laws) into machine learning methods. Our backgrounds and expertise compliment each other well, and we believe the IAP will provide sustained funding for many years into the future given the promise and interest of using data science and machine learning, i.e. “Artificial Intelligence”, for petroleum engineering decision making.\nPublications. I have published more than 54 peer reviewed journal articles1 (&gt;32 in rank) and book chapters. I co-edited and contributed to the book, Handbook of Peridynamic Modeling (&gt;390 citations). I have consistently published in the top journals in mechanics and computational mechanics including CMAME (IF 6.6), JMPS (IF: 5.5), JCP (IF: 4.4), Computational Mechanics (IF: 4.4), IJSS (IF: 3.7) and others. One significant paper was on the front page of the respective journal as a “most downloaded article” continuously for over 10 years2,3! Another paper, on nonlocal frictional contact, is currently on the most downloaded page in the Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling. My overall citations are strong (&gt;2900 citations) and growing, receiving more than 500 citations in each of the last two years (on pace for &gt;600 citations in 2023). My \\(h\\)-index is currently 27, I have 8 published works with more than 100 citations and 3 with more that 200 citations. Finally, it’s worth noting that my citations have continued to grow in an upward trajectory given the field of peridynamics has been growing rapidly. A screen capture of my Google Scholar citations chart is shown in Figure 1.\nSignificant Research in Rank. What I consider to be one of my most significant works in rank was recently published in the Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids (paper 26 on CV). This paper implements an advanced microplane constitutive model (M7) developed by Prof. Zdeněk Bažant (NAS, NAE, AAAS, Royal Society of London, 7 honorary doctorates, etc.) and students over many years for concrete and other quasi-brittle materials. Prof. Bažant has long been a critic of peridynamics. After many unsuccessful conversations trying to convince him that peridynamics could be viewed as a regularized discritization technique that allows for straightforward modeling of material failure without mass loss, I initiated a research collaboration with Prof. Yuri Bazilevs and Dr. Masoud Behzadinasab at Brown University to demonstrate this claim clearly. Masoud was a recent UT-Engineering Mechanics PhD who graduated under my supervision. His PhD work had all the foundational elements for implementing the M7 model easily in our open source Peridigm code. Masoud and I implemented the M7 model that is distributed by Prof. Bažant as an Abaqus UMAT material model written in Fortran 90. Without changing a single line of the constitutive model code, we built a UMAT interface to Peridigm and ran 11 different numerical validation experiments. These tests all involved different stress loading paths and various fracture/notch tests to elucidate the effects of pressure dependence, stress triaxiality, size effects, and other factors on concrete failure. The results we published demonstrate good agreement with all 11 tests and the published computational results from Prof. Bažant’s group using a regularized finite element implementation. Unlike the finite element results, our peridynamics simulations also show fracture localization and fracture patterns that are more in agreement with experiments. I see this work as the culmination of many years of constitutive model development from my group to provide a stable and accurate discretization technique that can use any classical stress-strain constitutive model for fracture modeling. The papers directly related to kinematic measures and constitutive model development that lead to this work are papers 3, 8, 9, 10, 12, 17 on my CV. Additionally, papers 4, 16, 18 were related to high-order discretization techniques that were demonstrated to produce the numerically stable formulation used in this work. When this work was published, Dr. Stewart Silling from Sandia National Laboratories, the originator of peridynamic theory and Distingushed Member of the Technical Staff (highest technical rank at Sandia) with over 18k citations, wrote us and personally thanked us for writing the paper, with the sentiment that the paper rebutted Prof. Bažant’s criticisms. A screenshot of this email is shown in Figure 2.\nOne of the papers mentioned above, paper 18, I also consider to be of high-significance. It was published in the SIAM Journal of Numerical Analysis. In that paper we present a discretization technique for nonlocal models based on reproducing kernel approximation theory that is proven to be “asymptotically compatible,” this means that the discrete solution converges to the nonlocal solution as the characteristic nonlocality is held fixed and the mesh is refined and converges to the local solution as the characteristic nonlocality vanishes along with mesh refinement. Additionally, it’s a nodally integrated collocation scheme; therefore it’s more computationally efficient than using Gauss integration techniques. We prove stability and convergence of the scheme by comparing to the Galerkin discretization of the nonlocal model which has previously proven to be stable. This paper demonstrates the mathematical rigor our group has applied to nonlocal computational mechanics novel method development.\nFinally, with my shift in research focus towards scientific machine learning in 2019, I have published several papers on the topic including papers 20, 21, 27, 29–31. I believe the most significant of these is paper 25, published in Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering in 2022. This paper presents a novel physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture for uncertainty quantification. The idea is quite elegant in its simplicity and performs remarkably well. We construct a feed-forward neural network and add physical balance laws described by partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss function that is minimized during training to “learn” the solution. The key novelty is that instead of a single output corresponding to the solution of the PDE, we allow for many outputs. Each output corresponds to the solution of the balance law for training data that has been sampled from a distribution. The data could correspond to uncertain measurements of the field quantities of the balance law, uncertain measurements of boundary/initial conditions, or uncertainty in material parameters depending upon whether a forward or inverse solution is desired (both are demonstrated in the paper). We show that we can train a single network to produce an ensemble of solutions that form a distribution. We demonstrate that this distribution agrees well with Monte Carlo simulations conducted by solving the PDEs via the finite element method. We present a method for quantitatively comparing the two distributions with accuracy measures. While PINN methods, when training time is amortized over some number of forward solution runs, often result in longer solution times with lower accuracy than traditional PDE solvers for forward problems (e.g. FEM), the MO-PINN technique can produce the uncertain distributions faster than traditional FEM-based Monte Carlo techniques. This is especially true for inverse problems. This technique has the potential for transformative impact in the field of uncertainty quantification for computational science and engineering.\nResearch related honors. I received the 2023 Society of Petroleum Engineers Regional Data Science and Engineering Award. In 2018, I was awarded a Moncrief Grand Challenge Award from the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences. I received a 2013 AFOSR Young Investigator Award, was named to the 2013 ‘40 Under 40’ from the San Antonio Business Journal. I have given numerous invited talks at both national and international symposium and elite universities (Caltech, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Illinois, Vanderbilt, etc.). I recently delivered a conference plenary lecture at Africomp 5. Among the other plenary speakers were Wing Kam Lui, a chaired professor at Northwestern University with &gt;60k citations, and Peter Wriggers, &gt;30k citations and widely viewed as one of the top technical and organizational leaders in computational mechanics in Europe, à la Tinsely Oden or Tom Hughes in the US.\nGrants. The tables below show research grants that have been awarded, pending, or proposed in the rank of associate professor. The total funds for the awarded and pending projects is $3.56 MM and my share of those awards is $1.23 MM.\nIt’s worth noting that I had two large grants, ARO ($345k) and AFOSR MURI (~$960k), that were awarded late in my assistant professor rank (therefore not shown in these tables, refer to CV) that carried over 2 and 3 years respectively after my tenure package was submitted. If we amortize the research spending of all awarded grants over time, we can see that I actually spent far more in rank than is indicated in the tables. This, along with the fact that my research is purely theoretical and computational (effectively only needing GRA support funds – no equipment) is how I was able to support the 8 PhD students who graduated under my supervision in rank  and is a primary reason that I wrote fewer proposals during the first few years of my associate professor rank. Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative research spending for my share of research grants since coming to academia.\nAdditionally, I shifted my research direction significantly in 2019 towards scientific machine learning applications in petroleum engineering co-founding the DiReCT IAP with Prof. Michael Pyrcz. Our efforts in launching this IAP were severely impacted by the COVID19 pandemic (we launched with 5 companies committed to join and then had 3 summarily drop out in the Spring/Summer of 2020 due to budget concerns and widespread layoffs that affected the oil and gas industry during COVID). However, the future looks bright as we now have 9 companies, including 3 that signed agreements to join just in the first half of 2023. I have included a projection for future research spending (my share), assuming the 9 companies we currently have continue in the IAP as well as the pending proposals that have been notified of award (Table 3) in Figure 3.\nFigure 3: Cumulative Spending\nTable 1: External Grants and Contracts Awarded in Rank - Current\n\n\nRole of Candidate\nNames and Roles of Co-Investigators\nGrant Title\nSource of Funds/ Funding Agency\nProject Total\nCandidates Share\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\nPI\n\nAssessing Capillary End Effects on Large Scale Tight Reservoir Drainage\nAmerican Chemical Society\n$110,000\n$110,000\n1/2021-12/2023\n\n\nTOTAL\n\n\n\n$110,000\n$110,000\nTable 2: External Grants and Contracts Awarded in Rank - Completed\n\n\nRole of Candidate\nNames and Roles of Co-Investigators\nGrant Title\nSource of Funds/ Funding Agency\nProject Total\nCandidates Share\nPeriod\n\n\n\n\nPI\n\nASCeND: ASymptotically Compatible strong form foundations for Nonlocal Discretization.\nSandia National Laboratories\n$300,000\n$300,000\n9/2018-10/2021\n\n\nPI\n\nStudent and Postdoc Travel Support for the 15th USNCCM in Austin, TX\nNSF, Proj.

    "text": "Overview I am a somewhat non-traditional teacher in that I rarely give a full 50/75 minute back-to-the-students blackboard-style lecture, preferring interactive project-based learning whenever possible. I have been an early adopter of the reverse classroom approach. I have developed three separate PGE courses (PGE 310/311, PGE 323M, PGE383 - High Performance Computing) using this teaching modality. As part of this approach, where the students watch recorded lectures posted before coming to class, I have posted 100s of lectures to YouTube which have been watched by others all over the world outside of the formal classroom. I currently have &gt;10,000 subscribers across multiple channels I’ve created for each class (see Figure 1).\nI believe this serves as a avenue for reputation enhancement, through others familiarizing themselves with my expertise on this topic and seeking out my other contributions in research, etc. Additionally, it creates a lasting catalogue of valuable reference material for my own students and researchers as well as other students at UT.\nPGE 310/3111 is the only required undergraduate class I regularly teach, the others are electives and graduate courses. I typically have high enrollments in these elective classes (&gt;20 students) and score well on my course evaluations. While the comments are ubiquitously supportive, I do get the occasional student comment that they don’t like the reverse classroom approach. These comments are difficult to address and are by far a minority. During the COVID19 pandemic, I did have a few semesters with below (my) average evaluations. I attribute this to the social and interactive “in class” part of these course being highly disadvantaged on Zoom. Since returning to in person classes post COVID, my course evaluation scores rebounded and even improved.\nReverse-classroom teaching. Over the last several years, I have developed three courses in a “reverse classroom” style and have automated the grading of assignments while providing rapid student assessment and feedback through the use of common open-source and web-based technologies that are in widespread use in software engineering. With the current excitement in all scientific and engineering disciplines regarding the use of data science and machine learning to solve problems, software engineering is becoming a highly marketable skill and soon will become an expectation of engineering graduates.\nFirst, I’ll provide a little background on the structure of the “reverse classroom” courses. All traditional lecture material is recorded a priori and distributed before the students come to class. The lecture material consists of discussions and annotations over prepared slides, derivations, and live coding or software demonstration/tutorials. The videos are intended to be 6-10 minutes in length and are uploaded to a YouTube Channel dedicated to each class. A sample of these videos can be seen at the following links:\nEach video has an associated quiz (3-5 questions) that is posted to CANVAS at least 24 hours before the class period where reinforcement assignments are used to deepen the students learning of the recorded material. The quizzes are intended to ensure the students watch the videos before they come to class. By taking to the time to perform some simple post-production on the videos, e.g. compressing/speeding the writing time for long derivations, the students can digest more material in less time than can be covered in a normal classroom setting, and, of course, with the ability to easily pause, rewind, and even listen at 1.5x or 2.0x speeds, the students can focus their learning in areas where confusion exists or clarification is required.\nIn class, we meet and work assignments, more than 20 assignments and several projects over the course of a semester. These classes are heavily focused on computer programming. PGE310/311 is an introductory course in numerical methods and computer programming. In 323M, we write a two-dimensional, two-phase fluid flow reservoir simulator over the course of a semester. In PGE383, we investigate different ways to speed up computations, through different parallelization schemes. The assignments are distributed and submitted via Github Classroom which uses the Github platform. Github is a cloud-based version control repository that is used ubiquitously by the open-source software community. A sampling of these assignments can be seen at the following links:\nAdditionally, I prepare the assignments in a way such that upon submission, they activate a continuous integration server (specifically Github Actions, also used ubiquitously by the open-source community) which pulls their submitted assignments into a prepared Linux virtual machine environment and runs their code against a set of prepared tests. The process is called “unit testing” or “integration testing” in software engineering. The continuous integration server immediately reports the results of the students tests to them. In the event they “fail”, the students can make corrections and continue to submit their assignments until the deadline.\nI have written a piece of utility software that, using the continuous integration servers application programming interface, can “scrape” the students results and upload them directly to CANVAS, i.e. automatic grading. The assignments are designed to be completed in one class period. To encourage the students attendance and participation in class a small “bonus” credit is given for submitting the correct code before the end of class. During the Summer 2023, I received academic development funds from the Cockrell School of Engineering to further enhance these automated grading tools and will be releasing them as an open-source toolset for others to use as part of this enhancement project.\nTechnology. This flipped-classroom format may not be appropriate for all classes; however, I firmly believe in providing the students a menu of options for learning, especially when technology can provide this at little or no time-cost to me. In the classroom, when delivering traditional lectures I use a tablet peripheral interface to my laptop, where I can either develop lecture notes from scratch on blank paper or I can annotate prepared material in real-time. This makes the transition to prepared slides, demos, videos, web-based materials, or live-coding on the laptop during the lecture seamless. While delivering the lecture, I wear a microphone and screen-capture my computer desktop while simultaneously projecting to the screen in the lecture hall. At the end of class, I post the lecture notes developed in class along with a YouTube video of my lecture. Every lecture is recorded and available for the students future reference. I spend a little time post-producing the lecture videos to break-up the full lecture into 5–20 minutes topical segments. This post-production of the lectures makes it easier for the students to find the material they are interested in when reviewing for exams or working assignments. Additionally, this allows me to easily assemble an appropriately timed lecture in the advent of an absence in future semesters. Written comments from students over the years have overwhelmingly expressed gratitude for these reference videos and other materials, as not all students learn in the same manner, it provides a way to accommodate several different learning styles. I have used this methodology in several PGE courses at UT including PGE 379 Advanced Geomechanics and PGE 334 Reservoir Geomechanics. Like the other courses described previously, these videos are being watched by students around the world and have nearly ~1MM views between the two channels.\nDuring the transition to remote learning during the Spring 2020 semester brought on by the COVID19 pandemic, I was asked by our department chair to form an ad hoc committee on to provide “best practices for online/distance learning”. We quickly developed a Wiki based on my experiences using various technologies for teaching, and I even personally recorded some “How To” videos to assist other faculty with this transition.\nIt has been my experience that many, if not most, engineering students are aided by visual learning tools and where appropriate I always try to incorporate these into my lectures. Figure 2 shows an animated computer visualization of tangent lines being drawn and new approximations being computed as a Newton’s method nonlinear solver converges to a root. This is one of many similar such visual aides that I developed (i.e. wrote the Python code) for a course on numerical methods, these notebooks are currently being developed to an open-source interactive book.\nGrading. I prefer a grading procedure which emphasizes homework assignments and projects that include applications to real engineering problems that the personal computer is needed to solve. As a working engineer, it was a rare case to encounter a problem that could be easily solved analytically; therefore, the computer plays a vital role in the education of my students just as it would assist a working engineer. I would say the primary educational goal for every course I teach is for the students to become better programmer/problem solvers through the use of scientific computing. I force the students to write computer code for nearly every assignment by designing problems that require iteration or full-field and/or multiple parameter space visualizations that are too difficult or intractable to work by hand. The students I have taught so far seem to respond well to these course designs.\nI firmly believe that, just as no exceptions are ever made for engineering students who must use a slide-rule when preparing exam questions (i.e. it’s an expectation that all students have access to a scientific calculator), we have reached the time when the same philosophy should be applied with respect to the laptop computer. Since the Spring of 2016, when teaching PGE 334 Reservoir Geomechanics, I have allowed students to use their personal or department provided laptops during exams. In that course, there are a class of problems which require using rotation matrices to perform multiple coordinate transformations for the solution. If the students are asked to solve these problems on an exam, an assessment of their performance is influence by how quickly they can type matrices into their calculators. This is not in anyway an assessment of their understanding. I allowed them to program the coordinate transformations and bring their codes with them to class. I even provided verification solutions so they could check that their code was working properly before the exam. They could simply use the code during the problem solution with little worry about making algebraic or typographic errors and allowing them to focus on their physical understanding of the problem. The overall grades on otherwise very similar exams improved dramatically from the previous semester when I taught this course.\nEvaluations. I have always been rated highly in student evaluations. The worst instructor evaluation I have received was in PGE323M during the Spring of 2020 (the semester we first transitioned to remote learning due to COVID), which has shown continuous improvement with ratings of 3.7, 4.4, and 4.68 in three times I’ve taught the course since. This improvement was in spite of requiring the students to program for every assignment (21 assignments and 3 projects)! I’ll also note that because of the larger enrollments and high response rates that all of my course evaluation scores represent good averages and are not artificially high due to only a few students responding.\nTeaching Awards I believe I have demonstrated real innovation in the classroom, notably through the use of technology, and I was awarded the 2015 Society of Petroleum Engineers Faculty Innovative Teaching Award and the 2017 Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Faculty Teaching Award. Another accomplishment I am very proud of, but is admittedly not completely my own, was for my Teaching Assistant for PGE 323M in Fall 2015, Nkemakonam Egboga, to be awarded the William S. Livingston Outstanding Graduate Student Academic Employee Award by the Graduate Student Assembly. This award, for which I prepared the nomination package, is given to one graduate teaching assistant in the entire university. Nkemakonam was the first PGE student and the first Cockrell School of Engineering student to ever be given this award."
