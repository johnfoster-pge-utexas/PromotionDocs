My research has been supported through competitive grants from ARO, AFOSR through a prestigious MURI grant, DOE, Sandia National Laboratories and numerous energy companies.  The distribution of these grants has been roughly 1/2 federal agencies/labs and 1/2 industry in rank. I co-founded the DiReCT IAP research consortium with Prof. Michael Pyrcz in 2019. Our IAP is one of the most successful new IAPs in the Hildebrand Department with 9 companies (Chevron, ExxonMobile, Coterra, Equinor, Shell, Total, Japex, BP, Aramco) as current members.  I was awarded an American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund "New Directions Grant" in 2021.

I received the 2023 Society of Petroleum Engineers Regional Data Science and Engineering Award.  
This award from the important Permian Basin Section "recognizes outstanding achievements in or
contributions to the advancement of data science and engineering analytics in the industry." 
In 2018, I was awarded a Moncrief Grand Challenge Award from the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences.  In 2017, I was awarded the Hildebrand Department Faculty Teaching Award.

I have given numerous invited talks at both national and international symposium and elite universities (Caltech, Northwestern, Johns Hopkins, Illinois, Vanderbilt, etc.). I recently delivered a conference plenary lecture at [Africomp 5](https://web.archive.org/web/20220816224636/https://africomp.info/speaker/). Among the other plenary speakers were [Wing Kam Lui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lzQvgDoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), a chaired professor at Northwestern University with >60k citations, and [Peter Wriggers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ERQy-O0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), >30k citations and widely viewed as one of the top technical and organizational leaders in computational mechanics in Europe, Ã  la Tinsely Oden or Tom Hughes in the US.
