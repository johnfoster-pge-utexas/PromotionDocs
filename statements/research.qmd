**Overview:** I am one of the [highest cited
researchers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=search_authors&hl=en&mauthors=label:peridynamics)
in the relatively new field of peridynamics and am the [fourth largest
code
contributor](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm/graphs/contributors)
to the most popular open source peridyamics code,
[Peridigm](https://github.com/peridigm/peridigm) (62k+ lines of code
contributed). Peridynamics is one of the leading computational methods
for modeling dynamic and pervasive material failure. It has been used at
Boeing for composite material aircraft design, at Corning for the
evaluation of glass in iPhones, and has been implemented in the popular
commercial FEA software LS-DYNA as well as several other open-source
codes. I have worked on problems involving both brittle and ductile
failure, participated in several [Sandia Fracture
Challenges](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10704-019-00361-1),

My research has been supported through competitive grants from ARO,
AFOSR through prestigious Young Investigator and MURI grants, Sandia
National Laboratories and numerous energy companies. In 2019, I shifted
my research to focus on scientific machine learning applications in
petroleum engineering, co-founding the DiReCT IAP research consortium
with Michael Pyrcz. Our IAP is the most successful new IAP in the
Hildebrand Department with 7 companies currently involved.

**Publications:** I have published more than 50 peer reviewed journal
articles[^1] and book chapters. I co-edited the book, "[Handbook of
Peridynamic
Modeling](https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Peridynamic-Modeling/Bobaru-Foster-Geubelle-Silling/p/book/9781482230437)".

Another paper, on nonlocal frictional contact, is [currently on the most

*Journal of Peridynamics and Nonlocal Modeling*. My overall citations
are strong and growing, receiving more than 500 citations in each of the
last two years. Finally, it's worth noting that my citations have
continued to grow year over year as the field of peridynamics has been
[growing
rapidly](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s42102-022-00082-5).

**Significant Research in Rank:** What I consider to be one of my most
significant works in rank was recently published in the *Journal of
Mechanics and Physics of Solids* (paper 48 on CV). This paper implements
an advanced microplane constitutive model (M7) developed by Prof. Zdeněk
Bažant and students over many years for concrete and other quasi-brittle
materials. Prof. Bažant has long been a vocal critic of peridynamics.
After many unsuccessful conversations trying to convince him that
peridynamics could be viewed as a regularized discritization technique
that allows for straightforward modeling of material failure without
mass loss, I initiated a research collaboration with Prof. Yuri Bazilevs
and Dr. Masoud Behzadinasab at Brown University to demonstrate this
claim clearly. Masoud was a recent UT-Engineering Mechanics PhD who
graduated under my supervision. His PhD work had all the foundational
elements for implementing the M7 model easily in our open source
*Peridigm* code. Masoud and I implemented the M7 model that is
distributed by Prof. Bažant as an Abaqus UMAT material model written in
Fortran 90. Without changing a single line of the constitutive model
code, we built a UMAT interface to *Peridigm* and ran 11 different
numerical validation experiments. These tests all involved different
stress loading paths and various fracture/notch tests to elucidate the
effects of pressure dependence, stress triaxiality, and other factors on
concrete failure. The results we published demonstrate good agreement
with all 11 tests and the published computational results from Prof.
Bažant's group using a regularized finite element implementation. Unlike
the finite element results, our peridynamics simulations also show
fracture localization and fracture patterns that are more in agreement
with experiments. I see this work as the culmination of many years of
constitutive model development from my group to provide a stable and
accurate discretization technique that can use any classical
stress-strain constitutive model for fracture modeling. The papers
directly related to kinematic measures and constitutive model
development that lead to this work are papers 25, 30, 32, 34, 36, 39 on
my CV. Additionally, papers 26, 38, 40 were related to high-order
discretization techniques that were demonstrated to produce the
numerically stable formulation used in this work. When this work was
published, Dr. Stewart Silling from Sandia National Laboratories, the
originator of peridyanmic theory, wrote us and personally thanked us for
writing the paper, feeling that the paper thoroughly rebutted Prof.
Bažant's criticisms once and for all.

One of the papers mentioned above, paper 40, I also consider to be of
high-significance. It was published in the *SIAM Journal of Numerical
Analysis*. In that paper we present a discretization technique for
nonlocal models based on reproducing kernel approximation theory that is
proven to be "asymptotically compatible," this means that the discrete
solution converges to the nonlocal solution as the characteristic
nonlocality is held fixed and the mesh is refined AND converges to the
local solution as the characteristic nonlocality vanishes along with
mesh refinement. Additionally, it's a nodally integrated collocation
scheme; therefore much more computationally efficient than using Gauss
integration techniques. We prove stability and convergence of the scheme
by comparing to the Galerkin discretization of the nonlocal model which
has previously proven to be stable. This paper demonstrates the
mathematical rigor our group has applied to nonlocal computational
mechanics novel method development.

Finally, with my shift in research focus towards scientific machine
learning in 2019, I have published several papers on the topic including
papers 42, 43, 47, 49--53. I believe the most significant of these is
paper 47, published in *Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and
Engineering* in 2022. This paper presents a novel physics-informed
neural network (PINN) architecture for uncertainty quantification. The
idea is quiet elegant in it's simplicity and performs remarkable well.
We construct a feed-forward neural network and add physical balance laws
described by partial differential equations (PDEs) into the loss
function that is minimized during training to "learn" the solution. The
key novelty is that instead of a single output corresponding to the
solution of the PDE, we allow for many outputs. Each output corresponds
to the solution of the balance law for training data that has been
sampled from a distribution. The data could correspond to uncertain
measurements of the field quantities of the balance law, uncertain
measurements of boundary/initial conditions, or uncertainty in material
parameters depending upon whether a forward or inverse solution is
desired (both are demonstrated in the paper). We show that we can train
*a single network* to produce an ensemble of solutions that form a
distribution. We demonstrate that this distribution agrees well with
Monte Carlo simulations conducted by solving the PDEs via the finite
element method. We present a method for quantitatively comparing the two
distributions with accuracy measures. While PINN methods, when training
time is amortized over some number of forward solution runs, often
result in longer solution times with lower accuracy than traditional PDE
solvers for forward problems (e.g. FEM), the MO-PINN technique can
produce the uncertain distributions faster than traditional FEM-based
Monte Carlo techniques. This is especially true for inverse problems.
This technique has the potential for transformative impact in the field
of uncertainty quantification for computational science and engineering.

**Research related honors:** I received the 2023 Society of Petroleum
Engineers Regional Data Science and Engineering Award. In 2018, I was
awarded a Moncrief Grand Challenge Award from the Oden Institute for
Computational Engineering and Sciences. I received a 2013 AFOSR Young
Investigator Award, was named to the 2013 '40 Under 40' from the San
Antonio Business Journal. I have given numerous invited talks an both
national and international symposium and elite universities (Caltech,
Northwestern, Illinois, Vanderbilt, etc.). I recently delivered a
