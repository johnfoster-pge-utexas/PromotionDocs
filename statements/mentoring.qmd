title: Mentoring Statement

With regard to assisting (primarily graduate) students in their learning process, I maintain an active blog of helpful tips and answered questions. Generally these are related to [scientific computing topics](https://johnfoster.pge.utexas.edu/blog/posts/hackathon/). I try to maintain a philosophy where anytime I believe a student's question will come up again in the future, I write a blog detailing the path forward as opposed to providing an individual answer. This has paid off numerous times where I can simply point the students to a blog post where I've already answered their specific or a similar question.

```{python}
#| label: tbl-students-graduated
#| tbl-cap: Degrees Conferred to Graduate Students Supervised
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('./students_graduated.csv', delimiter='|')
df = df.fillna('')
df.style.hide(axis='index')
```
